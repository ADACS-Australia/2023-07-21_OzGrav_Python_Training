## Acknowledgement of country
We wish to acknowledge the custodians of the land we reside on. These lessons were developed on the lands of the Wadjuk (Perth region) people of the Nyoongar nation. This workshop will be delivered on the lands of the Bedegal people (UNSW campus), and we will be using computing resources that are on the lands of the Ngunnawal and Ngambri people (Canberra region).
We pay our respect to their Elders and acknowledge their continuing culture and the contribution they make to the life of our cities and regions.


## Overview
This training was developed by [ADACS](https://adacs.org.au) for the 2023 OzGrav Winter School.

This workshop is intended for researchers who have little or no formal computing training, but who have learned to get by via self or peer learning, and who are interested to being exposed to some best practices in software development.

This workshop has been developed in the style of Carpentries (hence the site layout) but is not an official Carpentries lesson.
Some of the content is intended for learners to read, think, and ask questions, some of it will require learners to write code or use the HPC facility for themselves, and other parts will be treated as a discussion session where no or little computing interaction will be needed.

## Required software / services
You will need:
- Access to Zoom video conferencing system (for remote participants, depending on which works on the day!)
  - [Join from PC, Mac, Linux, iOS or Android](https://uwa.zoom.us/j/81308859132?pwd=RDZSdlg2QUtQejdkSll6MFp3QUZmdz09)
  - Password: see [etherpad]({{site.ether_pad}})
- An account on [GitHub](https://github.com/) is required for some of the activities.
- An operating system which gives you a proper command line (bash terminal)
  - For windows this means using something like [gitbash](https://gitforwindows.org/), [WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install), or the [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) prompt
  - For OSX or Linux the regular terminal will be fine
- Python 3.6 or later
  - We recommend installing python via [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)
- A zest for life

See instructions on the [home page]({{page.root}}#Setup)

## Optional but recommended software
- A integrated development environment ([IDE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment)) or text editor of choice
  - We recommend [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/)
- Miniconda
  - [MacOS](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/macos.html)
  - [Linux](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/linux.html)
  - [Windows](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/windows.html)


## Assumed knowledge
This course assumes that you have basic proficiency in python and bash.
If you are not familiar with these languages, we recommend that you complete the following lessons before attending this workshop:
- (linux) command line / bash [SWC Lesson](https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/), [ADACS Lesson](https://adacs.org.au/courses/introduction-to-bash/)
- Python scripting [SWC Lesson](http://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-gapminder/), [ADACS Lesson](https://adacs.org.au/courses/introduction-to-python/)

## Engagement

This workshop is developed for three main delivery methods:
1. Facilitated, in person, at UWA
2. Facilitated, online, in parallel with (1)
3. Self-paced, online, via this website.

This workshop is all about learning by doing.
We will be engaging in live coding type exercises for most of the workshop, and we will set challenges and exercises for you to complete in groups.
The more you engage with your fellow learners and the more questions that you ask, the more that you will get out of this workshop.

We will be using sticky notes for in-person participants to indicate their readiness to move on: please stick them on your laptop screen to indicate if you need help or are done and ready to move ahead.
For those joining online we'll be using emotes to indicate the same.

We will use a shared document ([etherpad]({{site.ether_pad}})) to manage and record many of our interactions.


## Conduct

This workshop will be an inclusive and equitable space, which respects:
- the lived experience of it's attendees,
- the right for all to learn, and
- the fact that learning means making mistakes.

We ask that you follow these guidelines:

- Behave professionally. Harassment and sexist, racist, or exclusionary comments or jokes are not appropriate.
- All communication should be appropriate for a professional audience including people of many different backgrounds.
- Sexual or sexist language and imagery is not appropriate.
- Be considerate and respectful to others.
- Do not insult or put down other attendees.
- Critique ideas rather than individuals.
- Do not engage in tech-shaming.
