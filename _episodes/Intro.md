## Acknowledgement of country
We wish to acknowledge the custodians of the land we reside on. These lessons were developed and delivered on the lands of the Wadjuk (Perth region) people of the Nyoongar nation.
We pay our respect to their Elders and acknowledge their continuing culture and the contribution they make to the life of our cities and regions.


## Overview
This training was developed by [ADACS](https://adacs.org.au) for the 2023 OzGrav Winter School.

This workshop is intended for researchers who have little or no formal computing training, but who have learned to get by via self or peer learning, and who are interested to being exposed to some best practices in software development.

This workshop has been developed in the style of Carpentries (hence the site layout) but is not an official Carpentries lesson.
Some of the content is intended for learners to read, think, and ask questions, some of it will require learners to write code or use the HPC facility for themselves, and other parts will be treated as a discussion session where no or little computing interaction will be needed.

## Engagement

This workshop is developed for three main delivery methods:
1. Facilitated, in person, at UWA
2. Facilitated, online, in parallel with (1)
3. Self-paced, online, via this website.

This workshop is all about learning by doing.
We will be engaging in live coding type exercises for most of the workshop, and we will set challenges and exercises for you to complete in groups.
The more you engage with your fellow learners and the more questions that you ask, the more that you will get out of this workshop.

We will be using sticky notes for in-person participants to indicate their readiness to move on: please stick them on your laptop screen to indicate if you need help or are done and ready to move ahead.
For those joining online we'll be using emotes to indicate the same.

We will use a shared document ([etherpad]({{site.ether_pad}})) to manage and record many of our interactions.


## Conduct

This workshop will be an inclusive and equitable space, which respects:
- the lived experience of it's attendees,
- the right for all to learn, and
- the fact that learning means making mistakes.

We ask that you follow these guidelines:

- Behave professionally. Harassment and sexist, racist, or exclusionary comments or jokes are not appropriate.
- All communication should be appropriate for a professional audience including people of many different backgrounds.
- Sexual or sexist language and imagery is not appropriate.
- Be considerate and respectful to others.
- Do not insult or put down other attendees.
- Critique ideas rather than individuals.
- Do not engage in tech-shaming.
